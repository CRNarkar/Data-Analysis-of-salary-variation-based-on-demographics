📊 Exploratory Data Analysis of Salary Variation Based on Demographics
This project focuses on analyzing how salary levels vary across different demographic factors using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The aim is to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships that can help understand the key drivers affecting income distribution.
🔍 Objective


To identify how demographic attributes such as age, gender, education level, experience, and geographic region influence salary.


To generate meaningful insights using statistical summaries and visualizations.


To support data-driven decisions for HR, workforce management, or compensation strategy.


🧩 Dataset
The dataset contains demographic and salary-related attributes, including but not limited to:


*Age


*Gender


*Education Level


*Work Experience


*Job Role


*Country/Region


*Annual Salary


🛠️ Methods & Tools
The analysis was performed using:


Python


Pandas – data cleaning & manipulation


NumPy – numerical computations


Matplotlib/Seaborn – visualizations


Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis


📈 Key Analysis Performed


Data cleaning & preprocessing


Handling missing values


Univariate analysis (distribution of individual features)


Bivariate & multivariate analysis (relationships between salary and demographic factors)


Correlation analysis


Visual exploration through histograms, boxplots, bar charts, and heatmaps


💡 Insights
Some of the insights uncovered include:


Salary generally increases with higher education levels and years of experience.


Certain demographic groups show noticeable differences in average salary.


Geographic region plays a significant role in income variation.


Strong correlations exist between experience, education, and salary.


📦 Project Deliverables


Clean and well-documented Jupyter Notebook


Visual analysis and key observations


Summary of insights from demographic-based salary exploration


🚀 Outcome
This EDA provides a deeper understanding of how demographic features influence salary variations. It serves as a strong foundation for future predictive modeling, HR analytics, or compensation benchmarking.
